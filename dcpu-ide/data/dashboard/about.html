<h3>About dcpu-ide</h3>

<p class="tiny">{{Version}}</p>

<p>dcpu-ide is inspired by Bret Victor's talk
"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII">
 Inventing on Principle</a>".</p>

<p>The IDE understands DCPU assembly code at a very fundamental level.
This enables it to perform some rather interesting and practical tricks which
really make development a pleasure.</p>

<p>It seeks to provide feedback to whatever you write as fast and unintrusivly
as possible. Where possible, this occurs while you are writing the code.
It also has a deeply integrated knowledge of how all your code interacts
with itself. Call graphs, detailed statitics on CPU cycle costs can all be
seen at a glace, while you are programming.</p>
