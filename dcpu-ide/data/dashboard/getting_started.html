  <h3>Dashboard</h3>
  <p>The dashboard is what you are looking at now and it is the central place
  from which we can control the IDE and our projects. It can be toggled on/off
  easily with the <code>alt+~</code> key. When working on code, it will not
  get in the way until you actually need it.</p>

 <li>
  <h3>Starting a project</h3>
  <p>The simplest course of action is to go to the <code>New Project</code>
  item on the left side of the screen. Follow its instructions and you can
  begin writing code. Use <code>Open Project</code> to continue working
  on an existing one.</p>
