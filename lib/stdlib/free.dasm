; void free ( void * ptr );
;
; A block of memory previously allocated using a call to malloc, calloc or
; realloc is deallocated, making it available again for further allocations.
; 
; Notice that this function leaves the value of ptr unchanged, hence it still
; points to the same (now invalid) location, and not to the null pointer.
